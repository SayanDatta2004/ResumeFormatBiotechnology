    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Shreya  and I’m from Kolkata. I have always been fascinated by the wonders of life and how technology can enhance it. That’s why I chose to pursue BSc Biotechnology at Amity University Kolkata College.

        Biotechnology is a field that combines biology, chemistry, mathematics, and computer applications to study cellular and biomolecular processes 12. It has applications in various sectors such as agriculture, health care, environment, and industry.
        
        I have completed my 12th standard from Dehli Public School,Udhampur Jammu School with 97.6% marks in PCM and Biology. I have also participated in various science fairs and workshops related to biotechnology. I have learned some basic skills such as DNA extraction, PCR, gel electrophoresis, and bioinformatics.
        
        My hobbies include reading books, watching documentaries, and playing badminton. I also like to volunteer for social causes such as animal welfare and environmental awareness. I believe that biotechnology can help solve some of the major challenges facing humanity today.
        
        My career goal is to become a research scientist in the field of biotechnology and contribute to the advancement of science and society. I hope to learn more about the latest developments and innovations in biotechnology during this course and gain practical experience through projects and internships.</p>
